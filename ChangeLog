	* Eliminated TreeStore as a separate module altogether and slurped
	its functionality into CountedStore. I saw no modular use for it
	anymore.

	* Made Counted.pm work with Apache::Session 1.51. Added Tree.pm
	and TreeStore.pm that were dropped from the Apache::Session main
	distribution. I have not yet understood all implications of the
	(undocumented?) interface changes that happened between
	Apache::Session 1.03 and 1.50, so I'm probably not very
	conforming. Who cares please let me know.

	PLEASE NOTE: This version does not work with Apache::Session 1.03
	anymore and it is not even compatible with earlier versions of
	itself too. So to upgrade from earlier versions it is necessary to
	upgrade both Apache::Session and Apache::Session::Counted.

	* Silence failures due to lots of calls to locking methods. We do
	not lock, period.
