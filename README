Apache::Session::Counted has a radical different worldview than the
rest of the Apache::Session modules. In short the advantages are:

    automatic lazy cleanup
    keeping track of transactions ("backbutton supported")

The disadvantages are:

    less stable code (pre-alpha)
    less supported code (future of maintainance unclear)

The reason why I developed this module is that it was already
(unpublished) working code before Apache::Session appeared on the
stage. I found it tempting to fit my code to Jeffrey's clean generic
module.

I'm publishing it because I see that the two advantages above still
seem to be unique in the crowd of alternatives.

Please consult the ChangeLog file for further information about the
status of the module and the manpage for documentation of how it's
supposed to work.
